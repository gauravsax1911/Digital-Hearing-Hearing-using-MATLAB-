# Digital-Hearing-Hearing-using-MATLAB-
A Digital Hearing Aid with interactive GUI for the user.

A noise reduction and frequency shaper function was made using MATLAB. 

Improvements have been made by using the development of digital sound treatment for the efficiency of
hearing aids.Nowadays, the digital hearing aids are small, which can be hidden inside the ear and have
an almost perfect sound reproduction. The research of Digital hearing aids has been growth and now a
small programmable computer that are capable in amplifying millions of different sound signals had been
constructed in the devices, thus improving the hearing ability of hearing-impaired people. The first digital
hearing aids were launched in the mid 80â€™s, but these early models were slightly unpractical. After ten
years later, the digital hearing aids really became successful, with small digital devices placed either inside
or discreetly behind the ear.

For the noise reduction part we have used the discrete wavelet transform over the fourier transform
